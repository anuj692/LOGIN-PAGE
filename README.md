This project involves designing a clean and responsive login page using only HTML and CSS. It focuses on creating a simple yet visually appealing user interface for a login form. The page includes fields for a username and password, a login button, and optional elements like "Forgot Password" and "Sign Up" links.

Key Features:

Responsive Design: The page is fully responsive, adjusting layout smoothly across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Center-Aligned Form: The login form is centered on the page for a modern, clean look.
Styled Input Fields: Each input field (username and password) has a customized design to enhance user experience.
Button Styling: A login button with hover effects for a more interactive feel.
Error Handling (Optional): Design placeholders for potential error messages, e.g., "Invalid username or password."
Animations (Optional): Subtle animations like transitions and hover effects to make the page more engaging.
Skills Practiced:

Structuring an HTML page and form elements.
Applying CSS for layout, positioning, and styling.
Implementing responsive design techniques using CSS Flexbox/Grid.
Adding basic interactivity with hover effects and transitions.
This project is ideal for honing front-end skills, especially in HTML structure, CSS styling, and responsive design principles.
